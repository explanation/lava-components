## The Lava Component library

#### Creating a new component

- Within the `/components` directory, ensure there is a single file for the component. Create any sub-directories or sub-components that you need as you are building this component.
- Within the `/screens` directory, ensure there is a single file for this component which represents it's screen. On the screen drop multiple instances of the component showing the different ways it can be used.
- Within `App.tsx`, add a button which links to this screen.
